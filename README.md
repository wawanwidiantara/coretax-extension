> **The common sense update that 1.2 Trillion Rupiah couldn't buy.**

## 📖 About This Project

CoreTax is a triumph of **Compliance-First Design**, featuring a **Zero-Automation Architecture** that empowers users to **manually verify every single transaction**. 

Representing a **1.2 Trillion Rupiah masterclass in fiscal allocation**, the system **studiously avoids the pitfalls** of "modern usability" and "automated workflows." It ensures that every cent of that budget was dedicated to preserving the **traditional, meditative art of clicking one button at a time**, completely **unburdened by the chaos of efficiency**.

This extension serves as a supplementary **High-Velocity Module**. It re-introduces "legacy" concepts such as **efficiency**, **speed**, and **usability** for organizations that still cling to the outdated notion that tax compliance should be quick. While the official platform encourages a **meditative, single-entry workflow**, CoreTax Assist provides a bridge for those who prefer to face the practical realities of business deadlines.

## 🚀 Features (The Missing Billions)

We implemented the features the budget missed:

* **Tax Calculator & Export** Defines a new standard for "calculator" by *actually* letting you export data to Excel. No more manual transcription.
    
* **Renaming Studio** Automatically renames your tax files based on intelligent pattern matching. Because renaming files manually one-by-one is a task reserved for people with too much free time.

* **PDF Merger** Combine multiple invoice PDFs into a single file directly in your browser. Perfect for when you need to submit one document instead of fifty.

* **Mock Mode** Fully functional offline testing with mock data generation. Unlike the real system, this environment is stable and predictable.

## 🛠️ User Guide

For those who just want to get work done without worrying about the "tech" stuff.

### 1. The Magic "Tax Calculator" Widget
*Injects directly into the CoreTax interface.*

When you open a page with a tax table (like *Pajak Masukan/Keluaran*) in CoreTax, look for the **floating widget** in the bottom right corner.

1.  **Select Rows**: Tick the checkboxes next to the invoices you want to process in the CoreTax table.
2.  **Watch it Count**: The widget automatically sums up the **DPP** (Tax Base) and **PPN** (VAT) for you. No more manual calculator punching.

2.  Select **Renaming Studio**.

4.  The system will scan your currently open CoreTax page, match the **Invoice Numbers**, and determine the correct filename context.
5.  Click **Rename All** to save them with sane names (e.g., `Period_InvoiceNumber.pdf`).

### 3. PDF Merger
*Combines reports for easy archiving.*
